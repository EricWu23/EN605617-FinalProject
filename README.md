# EN605617-FinalProject
Yujiang's final project of the course introduction to GPU programming at JHU

# Project Description
In this project, I 
1. wrote a kernel function in CUDA (grayscaleimagenormalization_kernel.cu)
2. wrote the host side caller (grayscaleimagenormalization_kernel.cu,launch_grayscaleimagenormalization.h)
3. wrote an python,C++ interfacing file (grayscaleimagenormalization_ops.cpp)
4. compiled our custom cuda_module using JIT option
5. normalized the pixel of raw gray scale image,which is between [0,255], to a number between [-1,1] by calling the custom cuda kernel from pytorch 

I also compared timing among pixel normalizer function implemented in 
1. pytorch called custom CUDA kernel, 
2. pure pytorch tensor running on CPU, 
3. pure pytorch sensor running on GPU.

Then, I trained a Neural network using pytorch to do dignit recognition based on the data preprocessed by the custom pixel normalizer defined in CUDA kernel.

## additional notes:
The data can be downloaded from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.
